# Tractor
The classic tractor game played with one deck of cards. The AIs in the game are beginner to intermediate level and usually only make basic in-game indecisions, but it should be reasonable for someone who is relatively new to the game.

To run the game, either upload or copy-paste the source code to codeskulptor.com and click run (you may need to do so several times before it works). Have fun!
